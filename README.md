# lead-score-generation

### Problem Statement

An education company called X education which sells online courses to industry professionals is suffering from poor conversion rates to their courses. So, they want us to build a model which helps them identify their most potential leads ('Hot leads'), so that they can be targeted easily by the Sales team to increase their conversion rate.

We'll perform Logistic Regression on the given data and generate the lead scores using the converted probabilities.
